The files in this directory are generated from the master 
documentation files in ../ecmadocs which are in the ECMA XML
file format for .NET Projects.

The files here are produced using mdoc export-html from the
Makefile one directory up.

The file `template` contains the XSLT template that is used to 
generate the documentation.

I welcome any contributions to spice the documentation up.
